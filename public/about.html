<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I began my programming journey during my undergraduate years as a materials science student. I worked for the U.S. Air Force Materiel
  command in the Air Force Research Laboratory as a student researcher intern. I wrote countless (probably hundreds) of programs to run
  data analyses in MATLAB and Python. I absolutely hated data analysis coding projects.

<p>I had to leave school in my junior year to care for my infant daughter who had multiple illnesses. After a year as a stay at
  home mom, I decided to learn web development as both a hobby and a means to continue my career in programming. I now live in 
  suburban Ohio with my two daughters and husband.
